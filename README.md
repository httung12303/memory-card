# Memory card

## About

This project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) curriculum. The game is very simple: don't choose the card you already chosen.

The cards contain images of Pokemon residing in the region which players choose at the start of the game.

## What I learned

This project, though simple, gave me experience in working with React, especially with the `useEffect` hook, and revised my knowledge of using APIs.
